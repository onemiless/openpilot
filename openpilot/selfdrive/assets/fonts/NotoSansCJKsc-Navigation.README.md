The ordinary UI font is a small translation subset that cannot represent
arbitrary Chinese road names. Only the navigation overlay uses this complete
font. It rasterizes the characters currently needed by the overlay, retains
them across frames, and reloads the atlas only when a new character appears.
Distance digits are preloaded; the full font's 44,810 mapped characters are
never uploaded as one atlas. The shared UI/Traffic font selection is unchanged.
